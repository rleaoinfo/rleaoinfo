### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hello, my name is Rafael LeÃ£o, I was born and raised in Recife, Pernambuco, Brazil, and I currently live in Porto, Portugal. I have a degree in Computer Science from the Catholic University of Pernambuco, and today I work as a Software Engineer, working as a Back-end Developer using Node.js.

Throughout my career, I've worked with a variety of technologies, including SQL, PHP, mySQL, C, C#, PL/SQL, VBscript, Siebel 6.3/8 and Oracle Database. However, my current emphasis is on working with the JavaScript language for the Back-end, mainly using Node.js. In addition, I adopt agile methodologies, such as Scrum and Kanban, to promote an efficient and collaborative approach to software development.
